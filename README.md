# USB sniffer for RASPBERRY PI PICO RP2040

This is a simple PS2 sniffer based on a Raspberry Pi PICO RP2040 (pico-sdk).

![](stuff/fullsetup.jpg)

I created this project to ensure that all the effort I put into my okhi project (Open Keylogger Hardware Implant - USB & PS2 Keyboards) can benefit more people: https://github.com/therealdreg/okhi

# Reporting issues

If you have a PS2-USB adapter that doesn't work with the sniffer, please send me some captures of the device using a logic analyzer or the pico-ps2-diagnostic-tool. This tool is designed to capture and replay signals on a PS/2 interface, specifically targeting the DATA and CLOCK lines:

https://github.com/therealdreg/pico-ps2-diagnostic-tool

![](stuff/originalvsre.png)

 A short pulse was captured on the original CLOCK signal, and the replayed signal successfully reproduced it.

# Download last firmware

Download the latest firmware from the releases section:

https://github.com/therealdreg/pico-ps2-sniffer/releases/latest

# Flashing the firmware

To flash the firmware, you need to put the Raspberry Pi Pico in bootloader mode. To do this, press and hold the button while connecting the USB cable to the PC. The Pico will appear as a USB mass storage device. Drag and drop the "pico_ps2_sniffer.uf2" firmware file to the Pico.

# Physical PS2 keylogger using a Raspberry Pi Pico

First of all, **PS2 signals are 5V**, and the Raspberry Pi Pico is 3.3V. To avoid damaging the Pico, we need to use a level shifter! Never connect PS2 signals directly to the Pico!

-------

I assume you have a breadboard, a set of Dupont cables (male-to-male, female-to-male, female-to-female), and a Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Connect everything

1. Connect the Lenovo PS2 Keyboard to the PS2-pin board:

![](stuff/ps2boardclose.jpg)

Connect PS2-pin board with the dupont cables to breadboard:

- Yellow: Clock
- Orange: Data
- Red: VCC
- Brown: GND

Each cable to one row of the breadboard.

![](stuff/adaptercbcolor.jpg)

Connect USB to PS2 adapter cable to the PS2 MALE CABLE and The USB PS2 Male cable to the other PS2-pin board.

![](stuff/ps2adaptercabledip.jpg)

Connect PS2-pin board with the dupont cables to breadboard, to join the PS2 signals of the two PS2-pin boards:

![](stuff/jointwops2.jpg)

Connect the USB to PS2 adapter to the PC. If the keyboard is working well done, if not, check the connections.

Disconnect the USB to PS2 adapter from the PC.

Now connect the I2C Logic Level Converter to the breadboard:

![](stuff/levelshift.jpg)

- HV1: YELLOW
- HV2: ORANGE
- HV: RED
- GND: BROWN

![](stuff/shifterbread.jpg)

Its easy, same colours go to the same breadboard row. ALWAYS CHECK THE CONNECTIONS!

Now connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to the breadboard:

![](stuff/raspcabl.jpg)

- PIN36 (3V3 OUT): WHITE
- PIN27 (GPIO21, SNIFF CLOCK): PURPLE
- PIN26 (GPIO20, SNIFF DAT): BLUE

Connect two brown cable to two ground pins of the Pico, and connect one to the breadboard (brown row) and other to the I2C Logic Level Converter (GND).

Connect from the I2C Logic Level Converter to the Raspberry Pi Pico:

- WHITE: LV
- PURPLE: LV1
- BLUE: LV2
(GND is already connected to PICO)

![](stuff/shiff3.jpg)

At this point all 5v signals are converted to 3.3v signals. And our Raspberry Pi Pico is safe!

All we have done is to bring all the signals together and make them accessible using the breadboard, then convert them to 3.3V to prevent damaging the Pico.

Finally, connect everything to the PC, and you're done! (Raspberry Pi Pico & USB to PS2 adapter).

**WARNING**: some USB Hubs can cause problems with this setup. If you have problems, try connecting ALL directly to the PC.

**WARNING**: Use short cables to avoid signal degradation (USB & Dupont). Avoid stack adapters, etc.

## Inspecting PS2 traffic

Connect to serial PORT (COM PORT) with a terminal program (like Putty, Tera Term, etc.), port conf:
- 9600 bauds
- data 8 bits
- parity none
- stop bits 1
- flow control none

To view available COM ports on Windows, open Device Manager and look for the "Ports (COM & LPT)" section.

**The COM port becomes available approximately 4 seconds after connection** (the firmware includes a delay before it starts).

Now, jus type on the PS2 keyboard and see the magic!

# Compatible adapters

Check the list of compatible adapters here:

# Adapter from hell

Creating a real-world keylogger has been challenging and is still in beta. Take a look at some adapters on Amazon: they produce a peculiar long CLOCK signal each time, along with short pulses before the actual packet.

The PIO code must be compatible with these kinds of signals. Although the protocol should follow the standard and theoretically shouldnâ€™t matter, unexpected behaviors occur in real-world scenarios.

Additionally, I found adapters that intermittently emit short pulses of various types, featuring fast rise and fall edges.

Supporting the "Adapter from hell" was a pain, check this:

Another PS2 to USB Adapter from Aliexpress with a fast 1.8us low pulse (CLOCK LINE):

![](stuff/lowpulse1p8us.jpg)

Note: These types of "glitches" do not affect the functionality of the PS2 keyboard and the adapter in any way, but they are a problem when creating a generic sniffer.
